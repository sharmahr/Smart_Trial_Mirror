# Smart_Trial_Mirror
Smart Mirror to try various things from specs to clothes.( Version 1)

This deep learning application in python can put various sunglasses on a detected face by finding the Facial Keypoints (15 unique points). These keypoints mark important areas of the face - the eyes, corners of the mouth, the nose, etc.

## Data Description
OpenCV is often used in practice with other machine learning and deep learning libraries to produce interesting results. Employing **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** in [Keras](https://keras.io/) along with OpenCV.

Step 0 - Download the _'training.zip'_ file from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/data) and extract it into the _'data'_ folder.

Step 1 - Execute ``` python model_builder.py ```

Step 2 - This could take a while, so feel free to take a break.

Step 3 - Execute ``` python shades.py ```
